Introduction to the use of computer based tools for the analysis of large data sets for the purpose of knowledge discovery. Students will learn to understand the Data Science process and the difference between deductive hypothesis-driven and inductive data-driven modeling. Students will have hands-on experience with various on-line analytical processing and data mining software and complete a project using real data.
</p>

<h2>
<a id="our-plan" class="anchor" href="#our-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our plan</h2>

<p>The plan this semester is to work through the analysis of real world datasets provided by the data science website called kaggle.com and from my own personal research. The class will be heavily structured around these projects. In fact, there will be only two examinations (1 midterm and 1 final). These will be on the theory of data science and the algorithms covered throughout class. The most important component of the course will be the practical experience gained as a data scientist, and this will be built upon by exploring:</p>

<p>Targeted data science lessons on concepts discussed in class. The topics will vary from week to week. They are designed to build up your skills to accomplish the next two tasks.
Predicting the survival rate on the titanic (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted">https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted</a>). This is the first data science competition that we will do as a class. As we progress through the class, there will be a number of assignments focused on this prediction task.
Bioinformatics: Next-generation genomics data analysis
Each week will have a consistent schedule. The first class will be traditional lecture style with a heavy emphasis on interactive discussion, where I will go over the theory behind the algorithms and concepts. The second class will be mostly lab style. My goal is to be your guide as you gain experience being a data scientist. Though this time will also be used to teach you the R programming language as well. It is during this second class and out of the classroom that you will gain practical experience as a data scientist. If you have laptops, please bring them to the second class of each week.</p>

<h3>
<a id="grading-policy" class="anchor" href="#grading-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading Policy</h3>

<p>Midterm - 15%
Final Exam - 15%
Homework - 10%
Programming Assignments and Final Project - 60%
Grading Scale: A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 65-69; F: &lt;65. Plusses and minuses will be used at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

<p>Grading Guidelines: Submitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and materials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy and reference below).</p>

<p>The grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.
The grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and medium-level achievement in the other.
The grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and medium-level achievement in the others.
The grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.

<h3>
<a id="homework-policy" class="anchor" href="#homework-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Homework Policy</h3>

<p>Written homework will placed under my office door by 5 PM on the due date. No late homework will be accepted. Cheating/sharing will result in a zero on the assignment and a report to the judicial board.</p>

<h3>
<a id="programming-assignments" class="anchor" href="#programming-assignments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming Assignments</h3>

<p>Programming assignments will be submitted through the Learn2Mine environment. There will be a combination of in-class lab assignments, and out of programming assignments.</p>

<h3>
<a id="honor-code" class="anchor" href="#honor-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Honor Code</h3>

<p>You must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).
You must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present someone else's work or ideas as your own.
In any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if any, and explain their contribution to your work.
Also see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.
Classroom Policies</p>

<p>You are expected to take good notes during class.
You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.
You are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (&gt;= 3) absences. If you miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office; also, you are responsible for announcements made in class, assignment due dates, etc.
You should turn off all electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, pagers, etc.).
In summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook, section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).
Late Policy</p>

<p>No late days will be allowed without an excuse. Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.</p>

The Anderson Data Science Research Lab specializes in applying data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, and metabolomics. We develop algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Our research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. We currently have multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition, toxicology, marine biology, medical genomics, biomedical informatics, and marine genomics.
